## üöÄ Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Push Your Code to GitHub

#### 1.1 Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `zama-news-bot` (or any name you like)
3. Description: "Zama FHE News Bot for Telegram"
4. Choose: **Private** (recommended) or Public

6. Click **Create repository**

#### 1.2 Push Your Code

Open PowerShell or Command Prompt:

```bash
# Navigate to your project
cd G:\zama-telegram-bot

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit files
git commit -m "Initial commit - Zama News Bot"

# Add GitHub as remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/zama-news-bot.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**If prompted for credentials:**
- Username: Your GitHub username
- Password: Use a **Personal Access Token** (not your password)
  - Get token at: https://github.com/settings/tokens
  - Click "Generate new token (classic)"

### Step 2: Deploy to Railway

#### 2.1 Sign Up / Login

1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Click **Login**
3. Choose **Login with GitHub**
4. Authorize Railway to access your GitHub

#### 2.2 Create New Project

1. Click **New Project** (or **Start a New Project**)
2. Select **Deploy from GitHub repo**
3. If first time: Click **Configure GitHub App**
   - Select which repos Railway can access
   - Choose your `zama-news-bot` repository
   - Click **Install & Authorize**
4. Back in Railway, select your `zama-news-bot` repository
5. Railway will automatically:
   - Detect it's a Python project
   - Find `requirements.txt`
   - Find `Procfile`
   - Start building

#### 2.3 Wait for Initial Build

- You'll see "Building..." in the Railway dashboard
- This takes 2-5 minutes for first deployment
- Railway is installing all dependencies from `requirements.txt`

---

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables

**IMPORTANT:** Your bot won't work until you add these variables!

#### 3.1 Open Variables Section

1. In Railway dashboard, click on your project
2. Click on the **Variables** tab (or **Environment Variables**)

#### 3.2 Add Required Variables

Click **New Variable** and add each of these:

| Variable Name | Value | Example |
|---------------|-------|---------|
| `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` | Your bot token from @BotFather | `123456789:ABCdefGHI...` |
| `TELEGRAM_CHANNEL_ID` | Your channel username or ID | `@zama_news_updates` |
| `CHECK_INTERVAL_HOURS` | `0` | `0` |
| `CHECK_INTERVAL_MINUTES` | `5` | `5` |

#### 3.3 Optional But Recommended

| Variable Name | Value | Why? |
|---------------|-------|------|
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | Your GitHub personal access token | Avoids rate limiting for PR monitoring |

To get GitHub token:
1. Go to https://github.com/settings/tokens
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"
3. Scopes: Select `public_repo`
4. Copy token and paste in Railway

#### 3.4 Apply Changes

- Railway auto-saves variables
- After adding all variables, click **Redeploy** or wait for auto-redeploy

### Step 4: Monitor Deployment

- Watch for any ERROR messages

#### 5.2 Test Manual Trigger (Optional)

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Bot Not Starting

**Check:**
1. Variables are set correctly
2. `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` is valid
3. Bot is admin in channel
4. Logs for error messages

**Fix:**
- Verify all environment variables
- Check bot token with @BotFather
- Re-add bot to channel as admin

### "Chat not found" Error

**Problem:** Channel ID is wrong

**Fix:**
- For public channels: Use `@channelname`
- For private channels: Get numeric ID
  - Forward message from channel to @raw_data_bot
  - Look for `forward_from_chat` ‚Üí `id`
  - Use that number (like `-1001234567890`)

### GitHub Rate Limiting

**Problem:** Too many API calls

**Fix:**
- Add `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable
- Increases limit from 60/hour to 5,000/hour

### Bot Stops After Some Time

**Problem:** Railway put it to sleep

**Fix:**
- Railway shouldn't sleep worker processes
- Check "Settings" ‚Üí Make sure it's not paused
- Upgrade to paid plan if on free tier

### Updates Not Posting

**Check Logs:**
```
Found X new blog posts
Found X new releases
```

If all zeros:
- Sources might be down
- Run test locally: `python test_sources.py all`
- Check if bot has already posted those updates
